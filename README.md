GDPR introduced many new privacy standards around the world, but it seems like that some providers requires you to untick a lot of checkboxes to protect your privacy atleast a little more.

Although this is illegal, a lot of companies uses theses techniques as opt-out from advertising and data-collections. This also only apply to European users, so international ones are still subject to unfair opt-outs.

## What does it do?

This extension is rather simple and allows you to check or uncheck all your checkboxes at the same time without having to click dozens of times on them.

One button and no more checkboxes ticked.

This extension also features another functionality for websites that do not use checkboxes, but buttons instead: the "Click all similar buttons" feature.

By using this feature on an "Off" or "Disable" button, it click all buttons with the same label, similar to how all checkboxes are unticked when using the normal button.
